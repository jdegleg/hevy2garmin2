"""Optional intervals.icu cleanup: delete a Garmin-sourced activity after merge.

Called from merge.py when an original watch activity is deleted from Garmin.
Prevents the original from appearing as a duplicate in intervals.icu after the
merged FIT is uploaded and synced.

Only runs when INTERVALS_API_KEY and INTERVALS_ATHLETE_ID env vars are set.
All errors are swallowed — never breaks the merge flow.
